stuf we should know
1. what bullets can hit us
	a. once a bullet has been shot, we only need to track it twice to determine its direction then we can determine whether it is dangerous or not
	b. we'd need to break bullets down into categories (perhaps by usage of inheritance) for dangerous and not dangerous
2. if we are near other bots (within three moves)
3. what general area other bots are in for attacking/evasive purposes
4. how other bots are moving (if they are moving)
5. in which directions our enemies can shoot us i.e. our safe spots to close in on them

evasive actions
1. determine a danger zone (possibly within 3 moves away to move if a bullet can hit us within)
2. not moving unless we are in danger (precedence over moving towards other bots if they arent moving)
3. if we are in danger move in a sensical way to either avoid or get into a shooting position

attacking actions
1. prefer to move and avoid rather than shoot
2. if we are not in danger and have a good lock on a bot, we can shoot

movement
1. i think we should move towards bots when there is a small enough number to try to kill them
2. we should maybe notice if we are moving too often in the same place (like in an oscillation situation)

different strategies depending on game type
1. 1v1 
2. free for all

general strategy
base on position away from enemies
have different types of movement (closing in on enemy, close enough to attack, evasive)
